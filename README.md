# NASA-API-MANUAL-TESTING
The goal of this project was to test the endpoint /mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos from the NASA API. After understanding how the endpoint works by reading the documentation, the next step was to create a table with all the parameters that are used in this API. This helped to keep track of all the inputs and outputs of the API and ensure that all relevant data is being considered. Next, positive and negative test cases were written to test the endpoint. This  helped to ensure that the API is working correctly and that it is handling different types of inputs and scenarios appropriately. Once the testing process was complete, a Task was created in Jira. The algorithm used during the testing process was described in the task, along with the table and all requests made during the testing process. This will help to ensure that the testing process is documented and that all relevant information is available for future reference.
